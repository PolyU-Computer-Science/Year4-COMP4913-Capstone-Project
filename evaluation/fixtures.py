"""Canonical evaluation fixtures.

These define the mailboxes, topics, custom fields, knowledge sources, and
connectors that the evaluation dataset and harness both reference. Ground-truth
labels in the datasets are *scenario-defined* against these fixtures — they are
NOT inferred by the model under test.

The IDs here are stable and shared between the dataset generator and the
evaluation runner, which seeds the same mailboxes/topics/fields at run time.
