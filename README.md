# PolyU — Agentic AI Email Assistant

> **Final Year Project · Department of Computing**

A human-supervised, multi-stage AI email assistant that combines
deterministic email processing with LLM-based reasoning.

The system retrieves emails through IMAP, classifies them using
schema-validated LLM outputs, generates response drafts, and requires
explicit human approval before SMTP delivery.

The project investigates the reliability, safety, and effectiveness of
agentic AI for practical email management, with structured output
validation, Human-in-the-Loop controls, and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG).

## Project Overview

This project builds a **multi-mailbox agentic AI email assistant** that
separates deterministic software operations from probabilistic LLM reasoning.
Each **mailbox is an isolated business context** — with its own topics, custom
fields, knowledge base, connectors, and AI behaviour — so the same engine
serves Support, Sales, HR, etc. without cross-context leakage.

- **Python Fetcher (`core/email_fetcher.py`):** Deterministic per-mailbox IMAP retrieval via `imap-tools` — no LLM tokens spent on mechanical operations.
- **CrewAI Engine:** Staged LLM reasoning (Classifier → Drafter) with Pydantic-validated structured outputs.
- **Knowledge / RAG:** Mailbox-scoped indexing, chunking, embeddings, and retrieval that grounds the drafter.
- **MCP Runtime:** Connector tool discovery with default-deny permissions and audit logging.
- **Routing Engine:** Deterministic case routing maps mailbox-scoped classifications and extracted fields to operational teams, then assigns work to eligible agents using configurable manual, round-robin, or balanced strategies.
- **FastAPI Backend (`backend/app/`):** REST API for email sync, AI processing, case management, and runtime settings — all state persisted in SQLite.
- **React Frontend (`frontend/`):** Human-in-the-Loop UI for reviewing, editing, approving, and sending AI-generated drafts.
- **Observability:** Per-stage processing runs recording latency, token usage, and failures.

### Research Focus

This project investigates three central challenges in practical
LLM-based email automation:

- the **reliability** of structured AI outputs;
- **grounding** generated replies in organisational knowledge;
- **safe control** of AI-generated external actions.

---

## Problem Statement

Email remains an important communication channel in modern organisations,
but managing high volumes of messages can create significant information and
workflow overhead.

Existing LLM-based email assistants introduce several technical challenges:

1. **Unreliable structured output** — free-form LLM responses may produce
   malformed or inconsistent data that cannot safely drive downstream
   workflows.

2. **Hallucination and insufficient grounding** — generated replies may
   contain information unsupported by organisational knowledge.

3. **Excessive AI autonomy** — allowing an LLM to directly perform external
   actions such as sending email can introduce safety risks.

4. **Unnecessary use of LLM reasoning** — deterministic operations such as
   email retrieval do not require probabilistic AI reasoning.

5. **Manual triage and unclear ownership** — classification alone does not
   ensure that an incoming request reaches the appropriate operational team or
   an available human agent.

This project investigates a hybrid architecture that separates deterministic
operations from LLM reasoning and introduces structured validation, knowledge
grounding, and human approval.

## Research Questions & Measurable Objectives

### Research Questions

This project investigates the following questions:

**RQ1 — Classification Reliability**  
How accurately can LLMs classify incoming emails into predefined operational
categories?

**RQ2 — Structured Output Reliability**  
Does schema-constrained structured output reduce invalid or unparseable AI
responses compared with unconstrained generation?

**RQ3 — Retrieval-Augmented Generation**  
Does grounding email drafting with retrieved organisational knowledge improve
factual faithfulness and response relevance?

**RQ4 — Model Trade-offs**  
What trade-offs exist between classification quality, response quality,
latency, token usage, and cost across local and hosted LLMs?

**RQ5 — Safety**  
Can a Human-in-the-Loop architecture restrict potentially harmful agent
actions while preserving useful AI automation?

**RQ6 — Operational Routing**  
Can AI-derived email classifications be reliably transformed into
deterministic team and agent assignments under configurable routing policies?

### Measurable Objectives

| ID | Objective | Evaluation |
|---|---|---|
| O1 | Classify emails into question, incident, problem, task and spam | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Macro-F1 |
| O2 | Produce machine-readable classification output reliably | Structured-output validity rate |
| O3 | Generate useful and contextually appropriate reply drafts | Human evaluation + response relevance |
| O4 | Ground replies using organisational knowledge | Faithfulness, context precision and relevance |
| O5 | Prevent AI-generated replies from being sent without human approval | Safety/integration tests |
| O6 | Evaluate different LLM configurations | Quality, latency, token usage and cost |
| O7 | Route classified cases to the appropriate team and available agent using configurable deterministic policies | Team-routing accuracy, assignment success rate, unassigned rate, workload distribution |

## Key Contributions

The main contributions of this project are:

- A **hybrid deterministic–agentic architecture** separating mechanical email
  operations from LLM reasoning.
- A **multi-mailbox context model** where each mailbox is an isolated business
  context (topics, custom fields, knowledge, connectors, AI behaviour), enforced
  at the data, retrieval, tool, and observability layers.
- A **staged Classifier → Drafter workflow** with independently configurable
  LLM settings.
- **Schema-validated classification** using Pydantic with fallback handling
  for non-standard local-model outputs.
- **AI topic + custom-field extraction** with server-side validation and
  partial-success handling; manual values are protected from AI overwrites.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** grounded in mailbox-scoped, indexed
  knowledge with provenance tracking and injection-safe prompts.
- **MCP tool permissions** with default-deny enforcement and audit logging.
- A deterministic **Team & Agent Routing Engine** that transforms AI-derived
  topics, priorities, and structured fields into auditable work assignments
  without delegating personnel decisions directly to the LLM.
- A **Human-in-the-Loop approval workflow** that separates AI-generated drafts
  from external email actions.
- **Runtime-selectable local and hosted LLM providers.**
- **Encrypted persistence** of email and AI configuration.
- An **observability layer** (per-stage latency and token usage) and an
  **evaluation framework** for classification, structured-output reliability,
  RAG quality, model latency, and safety.

### How Data Flows

1. **Sync** — the backend triggers the deterministic per-mailbox fetcher, which
   pulls unread emails via IMAP and stores them as deduplicated tickets tagged
   with `mailbox_id`.
2. **Process** — the staged pipeline runs mailbox-scoped: the Classifier uses
   the mailbox's topics; knowledge is retrieved from the mailbox's own index;
   the Drafter grounds its reply in that context.
3. **Route** — the deterministic routing engine maps the case's classification
   and fields to a team (first-match routing rules), then the team's assignment
   strategy selects an eligible agent.
4. **Review & Send** — the human edits/approves the draft in the UI, then the
   backend sends it via SMTP using the enabled mail account.

---

## Why This Architecture?

### Why is email fetching deterministic?

Email retrieval through IMAP is a predictable software operation and does not
require semantic reasoning. Keeping it outside the LLM pipeline reduces
unnecessary model calls, latency, token usage, and non-deterministic behaviour.

### Why separate classification and drafting?

Classification and drafting have different objectives and evaluation criteria.
Separating them makes each stage independently observable, configurable,
testable, and replaceable.

### Why validate classification output?

Downstream application logic depends on predictable fields such as category,
priority and urgency. Structured validation creates an explicit contract
between the probabilistic LLM and deterministic application code.

### Why Human-in-the-Loop?

Generating a draft and performing an external action are treated as different
trust boundaries. The AI may propose a response, but the user retains
authority over sending it.

The pipeline is therefore **hybrid deterministic–agentic**, not "everything is
AI":

```text
deterministic (IMAP fetch)
        ↓
AI reasoning (classify → draft)
        ↓
deterministic (SMTP send, after human gate)
```

---

## Multi-Mailbox Context Model

A mailbox is an **isolated business context**, not just an email account. Each
mailbox owns its own taxonomy and grounding, and `mailbox_id` is enforced as a
hard boundary at every layer:

```text
Mailbox
  ├── Topics        → constrain the classifier (resolve + validate)
  ├── Custom Fields → typed, validated, partial-success extraction
  ├── Knowledge     → mailbox-scoped indexing + retrieval (RAG)
  ├── Connectors    → default-deny tool permissions + audit
  ├── AI Behaviour  → per-stage model / temperature / instructions
  └── Routing Rules → map classified work to teams
                        ↓
                      Teams
                        ↓
                      Agents
```

This means a Support mailbox sees only Support topics, retrieves only Support
knowledge, and can only invoke tools permitted to Support — verified by
cross-mailbox isolation tests. Topics describe *what* an email is; teams
describe *who* is responsible; routing rules map the former to the latter
(rather than coupling topics directly to teams).

---

## Agentic Workflow

The email processing pipeline consists of a deterministic fetch layer followed
by a staged crew of two LLM-backed stages:

### Pre-Processing: Email Fetcher

Email retrieval is handled by `core/email_fetcher.py` — a plain Python module
that:

- connects to IMAP (folder and max-emails configurable per mail account) and
  pulls unread emails;
- extracts structured metadata (sender, subject, body, timestamp) and inline
  attachments;
- passes cleaned data to the AI pipeline.

This keeps LLM calls focused purely on reasoning tasks.

### Agent Roles

| Stage | Task | Goal | Tools |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Classifier** | `classify_email_task` | Determine category (question/incident/problem/task/spam), topic, priority, urgency, and summary. | None (LLM reasoning) |
| **Drafter** | `draft_reply_task` | Generate context-aware reply drafts matching professional tone, grounded in retrieved knowledge. | RAG knowledge context |

Each stage gets its own LLM instance with **per-stage overrides** (temperature,
max tokens, even role/backstory) stored in the settings DB — YAML config in
`config/agents.yaml` / `config/tasks.yaml` provides the defaults.

### Structured Validation

The classification task uses **Pydantic Structured Outputs**, forcing the LLM
to return strictly validated JSON. A tolerant fallback parser
(`core/classification_parser.py`) recovers classifications from local models
(e.g. Qwen3) that emit Python-literal style output instead of clean JSON.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class EmailClassification(BaseModel):
    category: str = Field(description="question, incident, problem, task, or spam")
    topic: str = Field(description="What the email is about, e.g. refund, bug_report, password_reset")
    priority: str = Field(description="low, normal, high, or urgent")
    urgency_score: int = Field(description="Urgency scale from 1 to 10")
    summary: str = Field(description="1-sentence summary of the email content")
    requires_reply: bool = Field(description="Whether a reply draft is needed")
```

> **Note:** `status` is intentionally **not** part of the AI classification
> output — it is a workflow state managed by humans/automations, not something
> the LLM should decide.

### Email (Ticket) Data Model

Each incoming email is treated as a **ticket**:

| Field | Meaning | Values | Set by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **status** | Lifecycle stage of the ticket | `new` → `processed` → `sent` (workflow states in DB) | Workflow (not AI) |
| **priority** | How urgent it is | `low` / `normal` / `high` / `urgent` | AI suggests, human can override |
| **category** | What *kind* of request it is (stable, small set) | `question` / `incident` / `problem` / `task` / `spam` | AI (classifier) |
| **topic** | What the email is *about* (open-ended subject matter) | `refund`, `bug_report`, `password_reset`, `lead`, … | AI (classifier) |
| **urgency_score / summary** | Auxiliary classification signals | 1–10 / text | AI (classifier) |
| **topic_id / topic_raw** | Resolved topic (id + raw model output) | integer / text | Resolver |

### Classification Categories

The **category** field is kept small and stable:

| Category | Description | Auto-Reply Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **question** | A question or request for information | Draft reply grounded in mailbox knowledge (RAG) |
| **incident** | A single occurrence of a problem | Flag for human review, draft holding response |
| **problem** | A larger issue affecting many | Flag for human review |
| **task** | Assignable action item | Draft acceptance/tentative response |
| **spam** | Unsolicited or promotional | Flag, no reply |

---

## Safety & Threat Model

Incoming emails, retrieved knowledge documents, and tool results are treated as
**untrusted input**. Each mailbox is a hard security boundary.

### Main Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Prompt injection in email content | Email text is treated as data, not trusted system instructions |
| Prompt injection in knowledge / tool results | Knowledge and tool output are wrapped as data, not instructions |
| Hallucinated classification | Structured schema validation |
| Hallucinated topic / field values | Topic resolution + server-side field validation (partial success) |
| Hallucinated reply content | Human review + RAG grounding with provenance |
| Excessive agent authority | AI cannot directly send email; MCP tools default-deny |
| Cross-mailbox data leakage | `mailbox_id` enforced across emails, cases, knowledge, connectors, runs |
| Credential disclosure | Secrets encrypted at rest, masked in API responses, redacted in audit |
| Runaway model execution | Token limits and request timeouts |
| External-model privacy | Provider is configurable; local models are supported |
| Incorrect AI-driven personnel assignment | LLM only supplies validated classification; deterministic routing rules select teams and agents |
| Assignment outside team membership | Backend membership validation before assignment |
| Agent overload | Capacity-aware assignment / unassigned team queue |

The system follows a **least-authority** design: AI components may propose
actions, while external side effects remain under deterministic application and
human control.

## Evaluation Methodology

| Experiment | Baseline / Comparison | Metrics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Email Classification | Different models / prompts | Accuracy, Macro-F1, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix |
| Structured Output | Free-form vs JSON prompt vs schema validation | Valid-output rate, parse failures |
| Draft Generation | LLM-only vs RAG | Correctness, relevance, completeness |
| RAG Retrieval | Different retrieval settings | Context Precision / Recall |
| RAG Generation | No-RAG vs RAG | Faithfulness, Answer Relevancy |
| Model Comparison | Local vs hosted LLM | Quality, latency, tokens, estimated cost |
| Case Routing | Topic/priority rules + assignment strategies | Routing accuracy, assignment success, unassigned rate |
| Workload Assignment | Round Robin vs Balanced | Distribution variance, max workload, unassigned rate |
| Safety | Adversarial / prompt-injection test cases | Unsafe-action rate, approval-bypass rate |

RAG is introduced as an **experimental grounding mechanism** rather than merely
an additional feature. The planned comparison is:

```text
No RAG:  Email → LLM → Draft
   vs.
RAG:     Email → Retrieve company knowledge → LLM → Draft
```

Evaluation will use RAG-specific metrics such as `context_precision`,
`faithfulness`, and `answer_relevancy` (via Ragas).

---

## Preliminary / Final Results

The evaluation harness (`evaluation/`) runs real experiments against the frozen
test split using OpenRouter (`xiaomi/mimo-v2.5-pro` for classification and
drafting, `qwen/qwen3-embedding-8b` for retrieval). The results below are a
**preliminary sample** (20 test records per experiment) and are reproduced with
`scripts/run_evaluation.py`; raw per-record results are written under
`evaluation/results/` (git-ignored).

### Classification (Support mailbox)

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Category accuracy | 0.00 |
| Topic accuracy | 0.90 |
| Topic resolution rate | 0.90 |

**Finding:** MiMo's out-of-box category output is not constrained to the
predefined enum (question/incident/problem/task/spam) — it emits free-form
labels such as "Technical Support" or "Customer Inquiry". This directly
motivates the structured-output validation + tolerant fallback parser in the
classification pipeline (RQ2). Topic extraction and resolution, by contrast,
are strong (0.90).

### Custom-field extraction (Support mailbox)

| Field | Accuracy |
| --- | --- |
| `order_id` | 1.00 |
| `severity` | 1.00 |
| `product` | 0.00 |
| Exact match (all fields) | 0.65 |

### Knowledge retrieval (Support mailbox)

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Recall@1 | 1.00 |
| Recall@3 | 1.00 |
| Recall@5 | 1.00 |
| MRR | 0.75 |

### Drafting (RAG, Support mailbox)

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required-fact coverage | 0.00 (substring match) |
| Unsupported-claim rate | 0.00 |

The drafting coverage metric uses strict substring matching and does not yet
reward paraphrases; this is a known limitation of the current automated proxy
and will be replaced with a faithfulness rubric for the final report.

> These are preliminary sample results, not a full run. The full test split is
> 320 / 160 / 96 / 80 records for classification / field-extraction /
> retrieval / drafting respectively.

## Limitations

- The five-category classification taxonomy may not generalise to all
  organisations.
- Draft quality depends on the selected LLM and prompt configuration.
- Out-of-box MiMo category output is not constrained to the enum; the
  classification pipeline relies on structured-output validation + fallback
  parsing to compensate (see Preliminary Results).
- The `hashing` embedding client is retained for offline tests; semantic
  retrieval requires `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openrouter` and an API key.
- The MTR MCP connector is an external demo dependency; automated tests use a
  mock transport so CI does not depend on it.
- External LLM providers may introduce privacy and data-governance
  considerations.
- The current prototype does not provide enterprise-grade RBAC or multi-tenant
  isolation beyond the mailbox boundary.
- Human evaluation of generated drafts may contain subjective bias.

## Roadmap

- [x] Refactor to pure CrewAI structure (`crewai create crew`)
- [x] Multi-provider LLM configuration with timeout & token safety guards
- [x] YAML-based Agent & Task definitions (Classifier, Drafter)
- [x] Pydantic structured output (`EmailClassification`) + tolerant fallback parser
- [x] Real IMAP email retrieval (`imap-tools`, per-mailbox)
- [x] FastAPI backend + React frontend
- [x] SQLite email store (content-hash dedupe, mailbox-scoped)
- [x] SQLite settings store — AI configs, stage settings, mail accounts
- [x] Encrypted secret storage (Fernet) for API keys & mail passwords
- [x] SMTP sending of approved drafts (SSL / STARTTLS)
- [x] Multi-mailbox context model (`mailbox_id` as data boundary)
- [x] Topics → classifier runtime (resolve + validate)
- [x] Custom fields → case runtime (typed validation, cross-mailbox reject)
- [x] AI topic + custom-field extraction (partial success, manual-value protection)
- [x] Knowledge indexing — chunking + embeddings + atomic replace
- [x] Knowledge retrieval — mailbox-scoped + retrieval test UI
- [x] Embedding compatibility safety (model change → reindex)
- [x] RAG → Drafter with provenance + injection-safe prompt
- [x] MCP runtime — discovery, permissions, audit (default-deny)
- [x] Observability — processing runs, latency, token usage
- [x] OpenRouter semantic embedding provider (`qwen/qwen3-embedding-8b`)
- [x] Real MCP transport (Streamable HTTP) — live-verified against MTR MCP
- [x] MiMo structured runtime contract (`xiaomi/mimo-v2.5-pro`)
- [x] Evaluation dataset v1 (950 records) + harness (metrics, runners)
- [ ] Teams / Agents / Membership (DB + CRUD)
- [ ] Case team ownership + assignee + assignment history
- [ ] Mailbox routing rules (first-match, configurable)
- [ ] Assignment engine (manual / round-robin / balanced)
- [ ] Teams / Agents / Routing UI
- [ ] Routing evaluation dataset + metrics
- [ ] Full test-split evaluation run (preliminary sample complete)
- [ ] CrewAI long-term memory via SQLite (`memory=True`)
- [ ] Final FYP Report
